Modules extend behavior.\n *\n * Key features:\n *  - One profile per wallet (soulbound; no transfers)\n *  - Global unique handle (case-insensitive via normalization)\n *  - Purpose tag (why this profile exists in the Verse)\n *  - Metadata URI (ipfs:// or https://)\n *  - Delegate/guardian for management\n *  - UUPS upgradeability + roles + pausable\n *  - EIP-712 meta-transactions for gasless updates\n *  - Module system with per-hook subscriptions and cheap dispatch\n *\n * Notes:\n *  - ENS linkage intentionally removed (can live in metadata or a module)\n *  - App-specific nicknames moved to a module to keep core slim\n */\n\nimport {Initializable} from \"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\";\nimport {UUPSUpgradeable} from
